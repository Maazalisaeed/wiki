Super Mario 64: Leaping into a 3D World**

Released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64, **Super Mario 64** wasn\'t just a

platformer, **Super Mario Bros. 64**, and launched it into a fully
explorable 3D world, forever changing the face of the genre.

**A World of Exploration and Freedom**

-   **Open-ended Levels:** Instead of linear stages, Super Mario 64
    presented players with vast, open-ended levels like Peach\'s Castle,
    each filled with secrets, challenges, and collectibles. This freedom
    of exploration encouraged players to find their own paths and
    uncover hidden surprises.

-   **Collectible Stars:** The primary objective wasn\'t simply reaching
    the end of a stage, but collecting 120 stars scattered throughout
    each level. These stars unlocked new areas, abilities, and
    challenges, further encouraging exploration and replayability.

-   **Innovative Controls:** The analog joystick provided precise
    movement control, allowing Mario to navigate the 3D environment with
    unprecedented fluidity. Players could jump, run, and perform
    acrobatic maneuvers with ease, mastering the controls to unlock
    Mario\'s full potential.
