## The game was released in 2005 by Kojima Production and published by Konami. The Video game is set in 1964 during cold war. Personally I was bit confused with the name and General time line of the series as this was the first ever Metal Gear Solid game I played but anyone can play it standalone as you do not need to know much about the first two games in the series as the this is a prequel to the original games. Overall I really love the movie like cut-scenes in this game. My fav character were obviously Naked snake or John and Eva Although the last boss fight was too long it felt like it was keep on dragging but it was filled with action
